# Real-Time Stock Dashboard
Real-time stock market dashboard that displays stock prices and updates them periodically. The application is built with Node.js for the backend, a frontend with React.js, and it utilizes SQL for data management. 

I am using this project to showcase my knowledge in full-stack development using the aforementioned stack.
